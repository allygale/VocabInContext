VocabInContext
==============
VocabInContext is a chrome extension which highlights and shows definitions for words as they appear in the context of the websites you visit.The words highlighted are pulled from a custom list that you curate.

Word list format:

word | definition \n

Words are stored in vocab.txt, in the same folder as the extension and separated by " | " (spaces necessary).
